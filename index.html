            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around 
                to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> 
                The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening 
                everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> 
                The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> 

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
                The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <tag class="bad">bad</tag>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> 
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
                <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>

                <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell 
                whether anything that happens in it is <tag class="good">good</tag>or <tag class="bad">bad</tag> — because you never know what will be the consequence 
                of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <tag class="good">good</tag> fortune.
